## In Vivo Imaging Systems {#in-vivo-imaging-systems}
\indent In Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS) are optical imaging devices used in scientific research to create 2D and 3D representations of biological organisms and processes non-invasively. These systems use advanced imaging techniques, such as bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging, to visualize and track various biological activities within an organism over time. This approach to optical imaging can assist in drug development, understanding disease behaviors, or other biological processes in their natural context @refaat2022in. Most IVIS Imaging methods implement optics in order to extract information about a subject based on the optical properties of the subject and the technique being applied. Many commercial IVIS systems can provide additional capabilities such as X-Ray, temperature control, computed tomography (CT), or accessories @vivo_imaging_system.

\indent While IVIS systems are able to create detailed images over a broad range of applications, they can be limiting due to their inaccessibility. IVIS systems tend to cost upwards of $100,000, which may bar smaller or less-funded research institutions from purchasing their own system @perkin_elmer_ivis_lumina. Renting the use of an IVIS system is typically in the hundreds of dollars range as well, which further restricts the accessibility of in vivo imaging @osu_small_animal_imaging_core. In addition to being high-cost, commercial IVIS systems are also restricted to the imaging applications they’ve been developed for with little room for customization or modularity. 

\indent The goal of the OpenIVIS project is to create a low-cost, open source and modular version of an IVIS system for biological imaging. Free open-source software (FOSS), free open-source hardware (FOSH) and the increased accessibility of rapid prototyping techniques, such as 3-dimensional (3D) printing, would allow for any institution to implement a version of this system in their research. An IVIS system with a modular design would also permit users to replace the imaging techniques used in order to best advance their work. Additionally, this would pave the way for implementation of in-vivo imaging techniques not currently available in most commercial systems such as Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI). This project is built upon the work done by previous members of the Harvey Mudd College Biophotonics Lab and the Colorado School of Mines Cash Lab, as well as their recently published paper @lee2024detection.


## Fluorescence Imaging {#fluorescence-imaging}
\indent One of the most common capabilities of IVIS systems is fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence is a highly sensitive analytical tool that is used to measure extremely low concentrations of a compound in a solution @williams1964fluorescence. The Jablonski diagram shown in Fig. 3.1 depicts the fluorescent process. When light is absorbed by a compound, molecules of that compound will become excited and raise to a higher energy level. Fluorescent compounds usually contain conjugated double bonds, where a certain number of electrons have greater mobility than the other electrons in the molecule @williams1964fluorescence. This greater mobility allows for more molecules to become excited when the light is absorbed. When these molecules return to their ground state, some of the energy is emitted as fluorescence.

![Fig. 3.1 Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence](./images/jablonski_diagram.png)

\indent The energy that makes up light are called photons. Photons that absorb and excite molecules hold a certain amount of energy that determines their wavelength, or color @saleh2018new. When a molecule emits a photon as it returns to ground state, the energy in the photon that is emitted is less than in the photon that was excited. This means that the resulting photon will have a longer wavelength and a different color @saleh2018new. 

\indent In order to image fluorescence, the absorbed and emitted photons of light must be controlled based on their wavelength spectrums. The excitation wavelength spectrum and the emission wavelength spectrum can often overlap, allowing the camera to capture photons of both wavelengths. An example of these spectrums is shown in Fig. 3.2, which is the spectrum for a common fluorescenct dye called Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). In order to see the fluorescence of a compound, only the emitted light must be captured by the camera. Implementing an optical filter can help to control what wavelengths are captured. Optical filters allow for wavelengths of a certain range to be the only wavelengths detected by a camera by filtering out other wavelengths.

\indent Fluorescence imaging has a variety of applications including medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and biological research. A common application of fluorescence is to non-invasively analyze biological molecules in vivo. Most IVIS systems use fluorescence for this purpose, and OpenIVIS will also demonstrate this fluorescence capability. 


## Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging {#laser-speckle-contrast-imaging}
Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) is an optical imaging technique used to track movement, such as blood flow, by visualizing blur. When a diffuse object is illuminated with coherent light, it produces scattered light waves which can be visualized as a random interference pattern called a speckle image @boas2010laser. Static speckle images have high contrast patterns but when movement is imaged, the fluctuations in intensity can cause the contrast between neighboring speckles to decrease. The speckle contrast, K, can be derived as the standard deviation of pixel intensity over the mean pixel intensity, as shown in Eq. 1. Moving objects, such as blood flowing in a vein, causes the speckle pattern to shift, or decorrelate @matthias2013laser. When this occurs, the intensity of neighboring speckles will become more similar, decreasing their contrast value. 

\begin{align}
K = \frac{\sigma }{<I>} \quad \text{(Eq.1)}
\end{align}

In order to compute the contrast of a full speckle image, a small window is applied to the original speckle pattern, typically 5x5 or 7x7 pixels large. This window, often referred to as a “neighborhood” is run over the entire image, computing the speckle contrast K for the intensities at each location before shifting over by 1 pixel at a time. The image is then reconstructed using the respective K values in order to produce a laser speckle contrast image. A speckle image is shown in Fig. 3.3a, and its corresponding LSCI reproduction is shown in Fig. 3.3b @matthias2013laser. By comparing the contrast patterns between different speckle images over time, the velocity of the movement being imaged can be determined.

Properties such as speckle size and autocorrelation can be used to verify camera settings and photo processing for higher quality speckle images. In order to determine the size of the speckles in the speckle pattern, autocorrelation can be applied to the image. Autocorrelation compares the intensity of the speckle pattern at two different points by multiplying values across the entire image. The autocorrelation can also be found by taking the fourier transform of the images intensity distribution @wikipedia_autocorrelation. Eq. 2 shows a speckle pattern’s autocorrelation calculation by taking the Fast Fourier Transform of the image’s intensity I(x,y). The transform is then multiplied by its complex conjugate, noted by the asterisk, in the fourier domain to obtain Fcc in Eq. 3. Finally, the inverse fourier transform returns the calculation to the spatial domain, resulting in the autocorrelation FA  as shown in Eq. 4. Given the autocorrelation of a speckle image, the size of the speckle in pixels can be determined by finding the width of the autcorrelation’s peak at half of its maximum, often referred to as the full width half max (FWHM). Most speckle images have a speckle size of one to two pixels. 

\begin{align}
F_{fft}(f) &= \text{FFT}\{I(x,y)\} \quad \text{(Eq.2)} \\
F_{cc}(f) &= F_{fft}(f) \times F_{fft}^{*}(f) \quad \text{(Eq.3)} \\
F_{A}(t) &= \text{IFFT}\{F_{cc}(f)\} \quad \text{(Eq.4)}
\end{align}
